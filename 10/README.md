# Lecture 10 Examples

`Person.java` is a simple class to represent a person. `PersonTest.java` is
a small program that informally tests this class.  Study this code, then
compile and run the program, before you look at any of the other files.

`Student.java` is a simple class to represent a student.  This class inherits
from `Person`.  `StudentTest.java` is a small program that informally tests
the `Student` class.  It demonstrates that a `Student` object supports
all of the methods inherited from `Person` whilst also adding its own set
of fields and methods.
